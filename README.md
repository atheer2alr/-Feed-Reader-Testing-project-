# Feed Reader Testing project 

## Project Overview
In this project we are given a web-based application and (**included Jasmine** ) that reads RSS feeds. 

## Jasmine: 
is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. 
* It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks.
* It does not require a DOM.
* And it has a clear, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

we learnd how to use **Jasmine** to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.
